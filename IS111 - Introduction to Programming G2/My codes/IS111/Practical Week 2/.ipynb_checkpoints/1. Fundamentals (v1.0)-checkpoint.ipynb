For each phone model we are selling, we need to store its brand, specs, price, etc. so that we can display such information to online shoppers.

    "    <li>A variable name cannot contain any space.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The first character of a variable name must be a letter or an underscore character (i.e., <code>_</code>), and the remaining characters must be a letter, a digit, or an underscore character.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
