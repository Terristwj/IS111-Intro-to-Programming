You should get the following output when running q1.py
```

<h3>Q2</h3>
You are given a file in the same directory, q2.txt, where each line contains some words separated by a space. Each of the words in the same line are in the same category. For example, line 1 represents fruits, line 2 represents drinks and line 3 represents proteins.

Write a program that prints out each word in one line, separated into their respective categories. You may hardcode the categories as "fruits", "drinks" and "proteins".

Your output should look like the following:
```
We have the following fruits:
apple
orange
pear
grape
grapefruit

We have the following drinks:
tea
soda
water
juice
coffee
oil

We have the following proteins:

```
