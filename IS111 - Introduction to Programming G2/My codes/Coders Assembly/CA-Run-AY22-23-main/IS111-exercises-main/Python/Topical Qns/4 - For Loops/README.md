<h3>Q1</h3>
Complete the function <i>count_vowel</i> that takes in a string (input_str). The function should return an integer, which represents the <b>number of vowels</b> in the string, regardless of whether they are capitalized or not.

You may test your code using the test case provided in q1.py
<hr>
<h3>Q2</h3>
Complete the function <i>seven_up</i> which takes in an integer (num). The function should print numbers from 1 to num (inclusive). Take note of the following requirements:

- If a number is divisible by 7, it should print "7-UP" instead.
- If a number is divisible by 14, it should print "Double 7-UP" instead. This should take <b>priority</b> over the first requirement.

You should get the following output when running q2.py:
```
----Test Case 1----

<h3>Q3</h3>
Complete the function <i>get_all_multiples</i> that takes in 3 parameters:
- an integer (start)
- an integer (end)
- another integer (divisor)

The function should only print numbers from integer <i>start</i> to integer <i>end</i> (inclusive) that are divisible by the integer <i>divisor</i>.

If everything works, your code should give the following output when q3.py is run:
```
----Test Case 1----
7
14
21

----Test Case 2----
