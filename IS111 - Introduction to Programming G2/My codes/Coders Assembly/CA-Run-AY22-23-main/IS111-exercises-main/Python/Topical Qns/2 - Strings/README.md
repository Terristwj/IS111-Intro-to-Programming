<h3>Q3</h3>
Complete the function <i>mask_email</i> which takes in a string, <i>email</i. The function should return the email string with all characters before the '@' sign masked with a lowercase 'x' (e.g. huiqing@gmail.com --> xxxxxxx@gmail.com). 

You may assume that the string entered is always a valid email with the '@' inside it.

You can test your code using the test cases given in q3.py
