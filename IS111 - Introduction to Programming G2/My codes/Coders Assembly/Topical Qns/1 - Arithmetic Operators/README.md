<h3>Q1</h3>
Complete the functions <i>calculate_rectangle_area</li> and <i>calculate_rectangle_perimeter</i>. The functions should return the area and perimeter of the rectangle whose length and breadth are specified.

Then, write a program that prompts the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle, calculate the area and perimeter using the functions created and displaying the results.

Sample Outputs:
```
Enter rectangle length: 5
Enter rectangle breath: 10
The area of the rectangle is 50.0
The perimeter of the rectangle is 30.0
```
```
Enter rectangle length: 25
Enter rectangle breath: 10
The area of the rectangle is 250.0
The perimeter of the rectangle is 70.0
```

<h3>Q2</h3>
Complete the functions <i>calculate_curved_cone_area</i> and <i>calculate_cone_volume</li>. The functions should return the area and volume of the cone respectively. You may use the following formulas to help you:

Curved area of cone = πr²
Volume of cone = 1/3 * πr²h

Then, write a program that prompts the user to enter the radius and height of the cone. Calculate the curved area and volume using the functions and display the result.

Sample Outputs:
```
Enter radius of cone: 5
Enter height of cone: 10
The curved area of the cone is 78.5
The volume of the cone is 261.66666666666663
```
```
Enter radius of cone: 9
Enter height of cone: 16
The curved area of the cone is 254.34
The volume of the cone is 1356.48

<h3>Q3</h3>
Complete the function <i>calculate_bmi</i> that takes in the <i>weight in kilograms (kg)</i> and the <i>height in metres (m)</li>. The function should return the BMI of the user. You may use the following formula to help you:

BMI = kg/m²

Then, write a program that prompts the user for their weight and height in <b>kg and cm</b> respectively. Use the function created to calculate the BMI, and display the BMI.

Sample outputs:
```
Enter weight (kg): 59
Enter height (cm): 160
Your BMI is 23.046874999999996
```
```
Enter weight (kg): 75
Enter height (cm): 180
Your BMI is 23.148148148148145
```

<h3>Q4</h3>
Complete the function <i>get_hypotenuse</i> that takes in the <b>length</b> and <b>height</b> of a right-angled triangle. The function should return the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle.

You may use the following diagram and formula to help you:

Then, write a program that prompts the user for the length and height of the right-angled triangle. Use your function to calculate the hypotenuse, and display the result.

Sample outputs:
```
Enter length of right-angled triangle: 5
Enter height of right-angled triangle: 10
The length of the hypotenuse is 11.180339887498949
```
```
Enter length of right-angled triangle: 3
Enter height of right-angled triangle: 3 
The length of the hypotenuse is 4.242640687119285

<h3>Q5</h3>
Write a program that prompts the user for 5 numbers. The following mathemtical operations should occur:

1. The first and second number are added together
2. The third and fourth number are multiplied together
3. The fifth number undergoes <b>floor divison</b> by 2.
4. The products of the 3 operations above are subtracted from one another in the sequence (Answer1 - Answer2 - Answer3)

The program should then display the final product.

Sample outputs:
```
Enter the first number: 4
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the third number: 6
Enter the fourth number: 9
Enter the fifth number: 8
The answer to the equation is: -49
```
```
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 1
Enter the third number: 6
Enter the fourth number: 18
Enter the fifth number: 3
The answer to the equation is: -96
```
