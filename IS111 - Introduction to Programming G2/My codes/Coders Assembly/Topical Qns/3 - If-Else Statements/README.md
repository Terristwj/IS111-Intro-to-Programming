<h3>Q1</h3>
Write a program that prompts the user for their age. If the user is 12 years old and below, the program should print out "You're a kid!", if they are between 13 to 30 years old (inclusive), it should print out "You're okay.". If they are above 30 years old, it should print out "You're too old!".

Enter your age in integer: 12
You're a kid!
```
```
Enter your age in integer: 30

<h3>Q2</h3>
Complete the function <i>greet_user</i> that takes in 2 parameters: a string (name) and another string (gender).

If the user's gender is M, they should be greeted as Mr.
If the user's gender is F, they should be greeted as Ms.
Otherwise, they will not have a salutation. Refer to the sample outputs on how your display messages should be printed when the function is called when q2.py is run.
